3D Renderer on OpenGL 4.6 (WIP)

A basic 3D rendering engine on OpenGL 4.5. Developed as a practice project to learn OpenGL API and modern graphics pipeline. I followed Learn OpenGL pdf book. My aim in this project was also to learn and write a component-based game engine, similar to how Unity uses GameObjects to develop the virtual world. I followed Game Programming Gems 6, to learn about Component-based game engine design.
